    <h4>
      (SAE)Student Automotive Engineering - Longhorn Racing Electric (Aerodynamics Subsystem Lead)
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed the aerodynamics package for the electric racecar created from scratch to compete in the Formula SAE Electric competition</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Design began with research on design processes, aerodynamics relative to racecars, and simulated design testing</li>
        <li>Design created via CAD on Solidworks</li>
        <li> Parts list includes front & rear wing, diffuser/undertray, sidepods*, and nosecone</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Ran simulations via Solidworks Flow Sim preliminary to manufacturing to find actual effect of the various parts</li>
      <li>Coded the simulation and expected results (downforce effects) into LapSim using Python to test the car as a whole</li>
      <li>Manufactured the various parts and mounting via composites, machining, and welding</li>
    </ul>
